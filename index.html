    <h1> My Inspiration</h1>
    <p> My inspiration is the writer of Shin Chan. Let me tell you some facts about him: <br> His name is Yoshito Usui. He was a Japanese manga artist known for the popular Crayon Shin-chan series. He was born in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. In 1977, he graduated from Saitama Kasukabe technical high school. After graduating he attended a part-time design-related college but dropped out. In 1979, he joined an advertising company called POP Advertising. He made his debut as a cartoonist in 1987 when Weekly Manga Action began running his Darakuya Store Monogatari. In August 1990, his series Crayon Shin-chan began running in Weekly Manga Action, the series started as a spin-off of the character Shinnosuke Nikaido of Darakuya Store Monogatari. An animated series based on the comics began in 1992, and a Crayon Shin-chan boom followed the release of a 1993 animated film. For a year beginning in 1995, Usui's Super Shufu Tsukimi-San comic strip ran in the magazine Manga Life. He and his wife raised two daughters; both had moved out of the house at the time of Usui's death. Iinspire him because of his creativitey, hardwork, imagination and many more things. If i was given a opportunity to become his assistant I would surely become one.</p>
